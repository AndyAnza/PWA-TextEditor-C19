## Description

I developed this application as a means to enhance my PWA skills. The primary purpose of this app is to assist users in capturing and storing snippets of information in the form of notes. It provides a convenient platform for users to create, save, and organize their personal notes within the application. By working on this project, I aimed to gain practical experience in building Progressive Web Apps while offering users a valuable tool for managing their information effectively.
